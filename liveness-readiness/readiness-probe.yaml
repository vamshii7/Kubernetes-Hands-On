# Readiness Probe Example
# Purpose: Controls when a Pod starts receiving traffic via Service or Ingress.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: readiness-demo
  labels:
    app: probe-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: busybox
    args:
      - /bin/sh
      - -c
      - |
        echo "Starting up..."; sleep 20; echo "Ready!"; sleep 600
    readinessProbe:
      exec:
        command:
          - cat
          - /tmp/ready
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 5
      failureThreshold: 3

#This example uses an exec probe. The Pod only becomes Ready after /tmp/ready exists.
#Until then, Kubernetes does not send traffic to it via Services or Ingress â€” preventing premature requests during initialization.
